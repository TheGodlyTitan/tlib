# TitanLibrary (tlib)

**TitanLibrary (tlib)** is a modular Python library designed to provide reusable components for various tasks. With separate modules for **configuration management**, **database handling**, and more, **tlib** is built to make it easier to develop Python applications with common functionalities that can be shared across projects.

This library is designed to be lightweight, customizable, and easy to integrate into any Python-based project. 

## Modules

### `tlib/configuration`
The **configuration** module handles loading, modifying, and saving configuration files (e.g., JSON, YAML). It provides a flexible interface for managing configuration settings across different projects.

For more detailed information: [*tlib/configuation*](configuration/README.md).

### `tlib/database` (Coming Soon)
### `tlib/testing` (Coming Soon)
### `tlib/logging` (Coming Soon)
### `tlib/cache` (Coming Soon)
### `tlib/apis` (Coming Soon)

## Installation (Coming Soon)

You can install **TitanLibrary (tlib)** using pip. You can either install the entire library or individual modules.

### Install the entire library
To install the full library, run the following command:

```bash
pip install tlib
```

### Install a specific module
If you prefer to install only a specific module, you can do so by specifying the module name. For example, to install only the `tlib.configuration` module:

```bash
pip install tlib.configuration
```
